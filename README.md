# Python-Code
Code from Personal Studies

This repository will include a snippy snippet of all the notes that I have already "compiled" during my journey through machine and deep learning 
with Python and R. 

This is by no means a list of extensive notes, this represents a tiny fraction of my self-studies.

The main purpose here is simple:
I wanted to upload these snippets of code in order to have a "back-up-proof" of all the data science, machine learning, and deep learning skills I advertize on my resume.
